2. Import and Export Techniques:
Demonstrated the use of import and export statements to achieve an organized code structure.
Ensured a clean and efficient codebase by avoiding a global code footprint through encapsulation within distinct modules.

3. Game Logic Design:
Structured the gameboard as an array within a dedicated Gameboard object.
Managed players using objects and orchestrated the game flow through a specialized object, enhancing overall game logic design.
